cl-glfw: The glfw wrapper for Common Lisp.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

GLFW threading WILL PROBABLY BREAK YOUR LISP. I would advise seeking other avenues if you
require threading in your applications. 

Platforms tested on:
    SBCL/Linux x86
    SBCL/Linux amd64
    Others: Let me know.

Features:
    All of GLFW 2.6.0 (broken threading, mutexes and conditionals).
    OpenGL bindings generated from the actual (supposedly) canonical spec-files from opengl.org
    GLU utility library (almost-hand-made binding)
    A few of the examples have been translated from C and are in the examples directory.
    Documentation copied from the GLFW specification documentation.

Enjoy.
